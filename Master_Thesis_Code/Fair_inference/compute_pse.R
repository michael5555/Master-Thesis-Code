# This script was adapted from the source code for Nabi and Shpitzer's experiments in the paper
# 'Fair Inference on Outcomes'. The script was adapted to perform fair inference on the data generated
# from the function generateWysiwygFIData() in the datagen.py script.
# The orginal code written by Razieh Nabi can be found in the following repository:
